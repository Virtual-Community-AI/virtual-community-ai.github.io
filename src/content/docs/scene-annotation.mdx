## Run

<ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
  <li>Prepare Google Maps Platform API keys with Places API enabled and create google_map_api.txt under the root directory. Then, paste the key into google_map_api.txt</li>
  <li>Open scripts/annotate_scene_all.sh and modify the scene(s) you want to annotate, for example, if you want to annotate TORONTO:
`SCENES=(TORONTO)`</li>
  <li>Run `bash scripts/annotate_scene_all.sh` to start annotation process</li>
</ol>

### Reminders

The script supports annotating multiple scenes at once, for example, `SCENES=(TORONTO ZURICH)`, we recommend annotating one scene at a time.

## Procedure

There are 4 steps in the annotation pipeline.

### Step 1: Prepare necessary files

### Step 2: Annotate scene places

### Step 3: Annotate transit and annotate the global image for places and transit

### Step 4: Take building photos
