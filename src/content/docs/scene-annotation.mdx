## Run

<ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
  <li>Prepare Google Maps Platform API keys with Places API enabled and create `google_map_api.txt` under the root directory. Then, paste the key into `google_map_api.txt`</li>
  <li>Open `scripts/annotate_scene_all.sh` and modify the scene(s) you want to annotate, for example, if you want to annotate TORONTO:
`SCENES=(TORONTO)`</li>
  <li>Run `bash scripts/annotate_scene_all.sh` to start annotation process</li>
</ol>

### Reminders

The script supports annotating multiple scenes at once, for example, `SCENES=(TORONTO ZURICH)`, but we recommend annotating one scene at a time.

## Procedure Overview

There are 4 steps in the annotation pipeline. We provide an overview of main sub-steps of each step. Please refer to the source code for full sub-steps.

### Step 1: Prepare necessary files
Move `road data`, `building_to_osm_tags.json`, and `center.txt` from `Genesis/genesis/assets/ViCo/scene/v1/SCENE` to `ViCo/assets/scenes/SCENE`.

### Step 2: Annotate scene places
<ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
  <li>Take the top-down bird's-eye view (i.e., global image `global.png`) of the scene, and save the global camera parameters in `global_cam_parameters.json`</li>
  <li>Search places using the Google Maps Platform API. If too few places are found, lower `search_resolution`</li>
  <li>Filter places. `filter_distance_square` presets to 300, which means filtered places are in the range of 300m x 300m</li>
  <li>Generate oriented bounding boxes of all loaded buildings in the format of `(cx,cy,cz,dx,dy,dz,theta)`</li>
  <li>Generate the obstacle grid and its parameters in `obstacle_grid.pkl`</li>
  <li>Generate scene-level metadata through accessibility filtering, extra places pruning, probabilistic place filtering, and place/building metadata alignment. This step generates `place_metadata.json` and `building_metadata.json`</li>
  <li>(Optional) Annotate the global image `global_annotated.png` for places</li>
</ol>

### Step 3: Annotate transit and annotate the global image for places and transit
<ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
  <li>Generate place clusters for bus, controlled by `num_bus_clusters`</li>
  <li>Generate bus routes and stops nearest to place clusters for bus</li>
  <li>Compute bus schedules</li>
  <li>Generate place clusters for bicycle, controlled by `num_bicycle_clusters`</li>
  <li>Generate bicycle stations nearest to place clusters for bicycle</li>
  <li>Generate the annotation image `transit.png` for transit</li>
  <li>Annotate the global image `global_annotated.png` for places and transit</li>
</ol>

### Step 4: Take building photos
Take a building photo for each building in the scene-level building metadata `building_metadata.json`, under `ViCo/assets/imgs/scenes/SCENE`.
