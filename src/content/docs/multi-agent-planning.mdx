# Multi-Agent Task Planning

Multi-agent task planning is one of the core challenges in Virtual Community research. This guide covers advanced techniques for implementing coordinated planning systems where multiple agents work together to achieve complex goals.

## Overview

In real-world scenarios, agents rarely operate in isolation. They must coordinate their actions, share resources, and adapt to the behaviors of other agents. Virtual Community provides sophisticated tools for implementing these multi-agent planning systems.

### Key Concepts

- **Distributed Planning**: Each agent maintains its own planning system while coordinating with others
- **Centralized Coordination**: A master planner coordinates all agent actions
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining distributed and centralized planning for optimal performance
- **Dynamic Re-planning**: Adapting plans based on changing conditions and agent interactions

## Planning Architecture

### 1. Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN)

Virtual Community supports HTN planning, which breaks down complex goals into manageable sub-tasks:

```python
from vico.planning import HTNPlanner, TaskNetwork

# Define a task network for community event planning
event_planning = TaskNetwork([
    Task('organize_event', [
        'reserve_venue',
        'invite_participants', 
        'coordinate_catering',
        'setup_equipment'
    ]),
    Task('reserve_venue', conditions=['venue_available']),
    Task('invite_participants', conditions=['contact_list_ready']),
    # ... more task definitions
])

# Create planners for different agent roles
coordinator = HTNPlanner(role='event_coordinator')
assistant = HTNPlanner(role='event_assistant')
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Planning Protocol

Agents use a sophisticated communication protocol for plan coordination:

```python
from vico.communication import PlanningProtocol

protocol = PlanningProtocol([
    'propose_plan',      # Agent proposes a plan to the group
    'evaluate_plan',     # Other agents evaluate the proposal
    'negotiate_changes', # Discuss modifications
    'commit_to_plan',    # Final agreement and commitment
    'monitor_execution'  # Ongoing plan monitoring
])
```

## Implementation Example

Let's implement a multi-agent system for organizing a community festival:

### Step 1: Define Agent Roles

```python
from vico import Agent, MultiAgentSystem

# Create specialized agents
event_coordinator = Agent(
    name='coordinator',
    role='event_coordinator',
    capabilities=['planning', 'delegation', 'resource_management'],
    goals=['successful_event_execution']
)

logistics_manager = Agent(
    name='logistics',
    role='logistics_manager', 
    capabilities=['venue_management', 'equipment_setup'],
    goals=['efficient_resource_utilization']
)

community_liaison = Agent(
    name='liaison',
    role='community_liaison',
    capabilities=['communication', 'participant_coordination'],
    goals=['maximum_community_engagement']
)

# Form the planning team
planning_team = MultiAgentSystem([
    event_coordinator,
    logistics_manager, 
    community_liaison
])
```

### Step 2: Implement Coordination Mechanisms

```python
from vico.coordination import CoordinationMechanism

# Auction-based task allocation
auction_mechanism = CoordinationMechanism('auction', {
    'bid_evaluation': 'capability_based',
    'conflict_resolution': 'priority_weighted',
    'communication_overhead': 'minimal'
})

# Consensus-based decision making
consensus_mechanism = CoordinationMechanism('consensus', {
    'voting_scheme': 'weighted_majority',
    'convergence_threshold': 0.8,
    'timeout_handling': 'fallback_to_coordinator'
})

planning_team.add_coordination(auction_mechanism)
planning_team.add_coordination(consensus_mechanism)
```

### Step 3: Plan Execution and Monitoring

```python
# Define the main planning goal
festival_goal = {
    'type': 'community_festival',
    'constraints': {
        'budget': 50000,
        'duration': 8,  # hours
        'expected_attendees': 500,
        'venue': 'community_park'
    },
    'success_criteria': {
        'attendee_satisfaction': 0.85,
        'budget_utilization': 0.95,
        'safety_incidents': 0
    }
}

# Execute collaborative planning
plan = planning_team.collaborative_plan(festival_goal)

# Monitor execution with adaptive re-planning
execution_monitor = ExecutionMonitor(
    plan=plan,
    agents=planning_team,
    adaptation_threshold=0.7,
    replan_triggers=['resource_shortage', 'weather_change', 'attendance_deviation']
)

results = execution_monitor.execute()
```

## Advanced Coordination Strategies

### 1. Market-Based Coordination

Agents can use economic mechanisms for efficient task allocation:

```python
from vico.economics import TaskMarket

market = TaskMarket(
    currency='utility_points',
    auction_type='sealed_bid',
    payment_rule='second_price'
)

# Agents bid on tasks based on their capabilities and current workload
for task in available_tasks:
    bids = market.collect_bids(task, planning_team.agents)
    winner = market.allocate_task(task, bids)
    winner.assign_task(task)
```

### 2. Swarm Intelligence

For large-scale coordination problems, implement swarm-based algorithms:

```python
from vico.swarm import SwarmCoordinator

swarm = SwarmCoordinator(
    algorithm='particle_swarm_optimization',
    parameters={
        'inertia': 0.9,
        'cognitive_weight': 2.0,
        'social_weight': 2.0,
        'max_iterations': 100
    }
)

# Optimize agent positions for maximum coverage
optimal_positions = swarm.optimize_agent_deployment(
    objective='maximize_area_coverage',
    constraints=['communication_range', 'resource_limits']
)
```

## Performance Optimization

### Computational Efficiency

```python
# Enable parallel planning for large agent teams
planning_team.enable_parallel_processing(
    max_workers=8,
    chunk_size=10,
    memory_limit='4GB'
)

# Use approximate algorithms for real-time performance
planning_team.set_planning_mode('anytime', {
    'time_budget': 5.0,  # seconds
    'quality_threshold': 0.8,
    'early_termination': True
})
```

### Communication Optimization

```python
# Reduce communication overhead
communication_optimizer = CommunicationOptimizer([
    'message_compression',
    'selective_broadcasting', 
    'hierarchical_routing',
    'batch_updates'
])

planning_team.apply_optimization(communication_optimizer)
```

## Evaluation Metrics

Monitor the performance of your multi-agent planning system:

```python
from vico.evaluation import PlanningMetrics

metrics = PlanningMetrics([
    'plan_quality',           # How good is the final plan?
    'coordination_efficiency', # How well do agents coordinate?
    'adaptation_speed',       # How quickly do agents adapt to changes?
    'communication_overhead', # How much bandwidth is used?
    'scalability',           # How does performance scale with team size?
])

# Analyze results
results = metrics.evaluate(planning_team, execution_results)
print(f"Plan Quality Score: {results.plan_quality:.2f}")
print(f"Coordination Efficiency: {results.coordination_efficiency:.2f}")
```

## Research Applications
