## What is Virtual Community?

Virtual Community is a comprehensive simulation platform that enables researchers to study multi-agent interactions in realistic 3D environments. Our platform combines:

- **Scalable 3D Environments**: Indoor and outdoor scenes with realistic physics
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Support for hundreds of AI agents with diverse behaviors
- **Research Challenges**: Standardized benchmarks for evaluating AI capabilities
- **Community Tools**: Collaborative features for sharing research and results

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.8+** with pip package manager
- **Unity 2022.3 LTS** or later
- **Git** for version control
- **CUDA-compatible GPU** (recommended for optimal performance)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/virtualcommunityai/VirtualCommunity
cd vico
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download Assets

```bash
# Download environment assets (this may take a few minutes)
python scripts/download_assets.py
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
# Run the setup verification script
python scripts/verify_setup.py
```

If everything is installed correctly, you should see a green checkmark for each component.

## Your First Simulation

Let's create a simple simulation with multiple agents in a community environment.

### 1. Initialize a New Project

```python
from vico import VirtualCommunity, Agent, Environment

# Create a new community simulation
community = VirtualCommunity()

# Load a pre-built environment
env = Environment.load('suburban_neighborhood')
community.set_environment(env)
```

### 2. Add Agents

```python
# Create different types of agents
residents = [
    Agent(name='Alice', type='resident', goal='daily_routine'),
    Agent(name='Bob', type='resident', goal='social_interaction'),
    Agent(name='Charlie', type='visitor', goal='exploration')
]

# Add agents to the community
for agent in residents:
    community.add_agent(agent)
```

### 3. Run the Simulation

```python
# Configure simulation parameters
config = {
    'duration': 3600,  # 1 hour in simulation time
    'time_scale': 10,  # 10x real-time speed
    'enable_logging': True
}

# Start the simulation
results = community.run(config)
```

### 4. Analyze Results

```python
# View simulation statistics
print(f"Simulation completed in {results.duration} seconds")
print(f"Total interactions: {results.interactions.count()}")

# Export data for further analysis
results.export_to_csv('my_first_simulation.csv')
```

## Understanding the Output

After running your first simulation, you'll find several output files:

- **`simulation_log.json`**: Detailed event log with timestamps
- **`agent_trajectories.csv`**: Movement paths for each agent
- **`interactions.csv`**: Social interactions between agents
- **`performance_metrics.json`**: System performance statistics

## Next Steps

Now that you have Virtual Community running, you can explore more advanced features:

1. **[Environment Customization](/docs/environment-setup)** - Learn to create custom 3D environments
2. **[Agent Behavior Design](/docs/agent-behaviors)** - Implement sophisticated AI behaviors
3. **[Research Challenges](/docs/challenges)** - Participate in standardized benchmarks
4. **[API Reference](/docs/api-overview)** - Explore the complete API documentation

## Common Issues

### GPU Memory Errors

If you encounter GPU memory issues:

```python
# Reduce the number of concurrent agents
community.set_max_agents(50)

# Enable memory optimization
community.enable_memory_optimization()
```

### Performance Optimization

For better performance on large simulations:

```python
# Use distributed computing
community.enable_distributed_mode()

# Optimize rendering quality
env.set_render_quality('medium')
```
