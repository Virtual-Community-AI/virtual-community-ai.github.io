## What is Virtual Community?

Virtual Community is an open-world platform that simulates human-robot coexistence in shared communities, featuring a physics-based multi-agent simulator and real-world 3D scenes to study embodied social and physical intelligence at scale.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UMass-Embodied-AGI/Virtual-Community
cd Virtual-Community
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# We're using python 3.11, cuda 11.7 and ubuntu 24.04. If you are using a different version, please modify the env.yaml file accordingly.
conda env create -f env.yaml

# Install Genesis from the source:
cd Genesis
pip install -e .

# (Optional) To run the example tour agent, install volume grid lib:
cd agents/sg
./setup.sh
```

### Step 3: Assets Preparation

Download the assets from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/15XR80efNfgdpYi-5dXh3lJ35p9WBqFc5) and organize them under `Genesis/genesis/assets/ViCo`.

<br />
Assets include:
<ul class="list-disc ml-6">
  <li>`scene` folder: contains the generated outdoor 3D scenes</li>
  <li>`robots` folder: contains the robot models</li>
  <li>`objects` folder: contains the object models</li>
  <li>`avatars` folder: contains the human avatars' skin and motion</li>
  <li>`cars` folder: contains the vehicle models including car, bus, bike, etc</li>
</ul>
<br />

If you want to use indoor scenes from GRUTopia, please follow their instructions [here](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/GRUtopia?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-assets) to download the commercial_scenes.zip, and unzip it under `Genesis/genesis/assets/ViCo/`.
<br />

After this step, the directory structure should be:

```
Genesis/genesis/assets/ViCo/
├── scene/
├── robots/
├── objects/
├── avatars/
├── cars/
└── commercial_scenes/ (optional)
```

## Run the Simulation

Run the following script to test the simulation, where 15 agents will tour around the New York Scene.

```bash
./scripts/run_tour_agent.sh
```

Tips: Loading all indoor scenes and objects may introduce a large memory cost. If you encounter memory issues, consider adding `--no_load_indoor_scene` flag to the script to disable indoor scenes.

## TroubleShooting

<ul class="list-disc ml-6">
  <li>`libstdcxx. so.6: version GLIBCXX 3.4.32’not found required by sg/builder/builtin/libbuider.so` To resolve this issue, you may need to update your GCC runtime. You can do this by running:```bash conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng```</li>
  <li>Only _pygltflib-1.16.0_ works for now, the latest version _pygltflib-1.16.1_ will slower the scene loading.</li>
</ul>
